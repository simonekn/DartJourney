# Introduction to Testing in Dart

This Dart project served as an introductory exploration into the realm of software testing. Its main objective was to provide a didactic model for studying testing concepts within the Dart programming language. The project encompassed a range of test scenarios and strategies.

The project began by establishing a foundation in testing by creating a series of tests that resembled a discount calculator. These tests compared values and offered percentages to calculate final values. This initial phase of testing helped participants become familiar with writing and executing basic tests.

Subsequently, the project advanced by grouping tests, showcasing the importance of test organization and structure. Grouping tests allowed for a more systematic approach to ensuring the correctness of software behavior.

In the final stage, the project expanded its testing scope by introducing URI-based tests. These tests verified the expected values produced by a URI. This part of the project served as a practical demonstration of how testing can be applied to real-world scenarios.

Overall, this project was designed as an educational and didactic model for learning about testing in Dart. It provided valuable insights into the principles and practices of software testing, making it a useful resource for those looking to build their testing skills in Dart programming.
