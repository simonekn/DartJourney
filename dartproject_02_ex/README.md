# Exception Handling Project in Dart

In this Dart project, the primary focus was on exploring exception handling mechanisms while building a console-based application. The project consisted of several key components, including models, general utilities, and the central Student class.

The core functionality of the project revolved around the Student class, which was responsible for receiving input data such as the student's name and their grades. The output provided information about the grades and calculated the average grade for the student.

One significant aspect of this project was the integration of exception handling. The application was designed to gracefully handle various types of exceptions, including those related to invalid names and incorrect grade input. Exception handling ensured that the program could recover gracefully from errors, providing a valuable lesson in robust software design.

This project serves as an instructive and didactic example of exception handling in Dart. It offers a practical demonstration of how to handle exceptions effectively, making it a valuable resource for those learning about error management in programming.
