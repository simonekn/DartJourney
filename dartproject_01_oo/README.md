# Object-Oriented Programming Project in Dart

In this object-oriented programming project implemented in Dart, the focus was on applying object-oriented principles to model real-world entities as classes. The central concept revolved around modeling individuals, considering that each person could be either a legal entity or a natural person.

The core class, Person, encapsulated common attributes such as name, email, phone number, and address. Two specialized classes, PhysicalPerson and LegalPerson, extended the Person class, adding specific attributes like CPF (individual taxpayer registration) and CNPJ (company registration number), respectively.

Moreover, the project delved into the realm of implementation details, exploring different strategies for notifying individuals. The notification system was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing notifications to be sent via email, SMS, or push notifications.

This project serves as an instructive and theoretical example of object-oriented programming in Dart, offering valuable insights for learning and understanding the principles of object-oriented design and implementation.
